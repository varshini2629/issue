devops introduction:
devops=development+operations 

its a culture +set of practices +tools that help:
--developers (who write code)
--Operations(who deploy manage systems)
.work together ,instead of working in silos.

Real time examples:
imagine you're buildings  a mobile app like swiggy.
the developer writes code to add "track my order"feature.
without devops:code gives code to ops team-->they manually deploy-->bugs happen -->delays.
with devops:code is automatically tested and deployed-->customers get updates faster and safely.

Devops helps you:
.releases features faster (like adding new payment methods in Zomato)
fix bugs quickly(like fixing login issue in irctc)
automates repetative tasks (like server restarts, database backups)
